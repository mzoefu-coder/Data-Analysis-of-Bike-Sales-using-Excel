# Data-Analysis-of-Bike-Sales-using-Excel
This project involved analyzing a customer dataset and determining the main factors driving bike purchase decisions. Age, gender, marital status, education, commute distance, and property ownership were among the lifestyle, income, and demographic factors included in the dataset. 

For analysis, the data was normalized, cleaned, and organized into an Excel table. I conducted statistical summaries and segmentation using Pivot Tables and sophisticated Excel algorithms to investigate patterns in the relationship between client variables and purchasing behavior.
An interactive Bike Sales Dashboard with slicers for region, education, and marital status filtering, as well as dynamic charts showing salary comparisons, age group trends, and commute patterns, was used to visualize the results. 

According to the data, middle-aged, well-off people who commuted a moderate distance were more likely to buy bikes. This project shows a high level of expertise in dashboard visualization for business decision-making, analytical modeling, and Excel-based data cleaning
